Native SQL data types

BIGINT (FB 1.5)
--------------

  Function:
    SQL99-compliant exact numeric type.
	
  Author:
    Dmitry Yemanov <yemanov@yandex.ru>
	
  Syntax rules:
    BIGINT
	
  Storage:
    64-bit, signed
	
  Example(s):
    1. DECLARE VARIABLE VAR1 BIGINT;
    2. CREATE TABLE TABLE1 (FIELD1 BIGINT);
	
  Note(s):
    1. Available in Dialect 3 only.
    2. Quote from the SQL-99 specification:

	SMALLINT, INTEGER, and BIGINT specify the data type exact numeric,
	with scale of 0 (zero) and binary or decimal precision. The choice
	of binary versus decimal precision is implementation-defined, but
	the same radix shall be chosen for all three data types. The precision
	of SMALLINT shall be less than or equal to the precision of INTEGER,
	and the precision of BIGINT shall be greater than or equal to the
	precision of INTEGER.


BOOLEAN (FB 3.0)
--------------

  Function:
    SQL2008-compliant boolean type.

  Author:
    Adriano dos Santos Fernandes <adrianosf at gmail.com>

  Syntax rules:
    BOOLEAN

  Storage:
    8-bit

  Example(s):
    1. DECLARE VARIABLE VAR1 BOOLEAN = TRUE;
    2. CREATE TABLE TABLE1 (FIELD1 BOOLEAN);

  Note(s):
    1. Quote from the SQL-2008 specification:

       The data type boolean comprises the distinct truth values TRUE and FALSE. Unless prohibited
       by a NOT NULL constraint, the boolean data type also supports the truth value UNKNOWN as the
       null value. This specification does not make a distinction between the null value of the
       boolean data type and the truth value Unknown that is the result of an SQL <predicate>,
       <search condition>, or <boolean value expression>; they may be used interchangeably to mean
       exactly the same thing.

    2. Represented in the API with the FB_BOOLEAN type and FB_TRUE and FB_FALSE constants.

    3. The value TRUE is greater than the value FALSE.

    4. Non-booleans values are not implicitly convertible to boolean in boolean-specific expressions
       like predicates and arguments for operators NOT, AND, OR and IS.

    5. It's allowed to test booleans without compare with TRUE or FALSE. For example,
       "field1 OR field2" and "NOT field1" are valid expressions. It's also allowed to compare with
       others operators, including the new IS operator: "field1 IS FALSE".


BINARY, VARBINARY, BINARY VARYING (FB 4.0)
------------------------------------------

  Function:
    Alias for CHAR, VARCHAR, VARYING CHAR with CHARACTER SET OCTETS.

  Author:
    Dimitry Sibiryakov

  Syntax rules:
    BINARY[(length)]
    VARBINARY(length)
    BINARY VARYING(length)

  Example(s):
    1. DECLARE VARIABLE VAR1 VARBINARY(10);
    2. CREATE TABLE TABLE1 (FIELD1 BINARY(16),
                            FIELD2 VARBINARY(100),
                            FIELD3 BINARY VARYING(1000));

  Note(s):
    1. If length is omitted for type BINARY, it is considered to be 1.
    2. Can be distinguished from text types by value 1 in RDB$FIELD_SUB_TYPE.
    3. Character set is set to OCTETS for backward compatibility.
    4. In API are similar to corresponding text types, getSubType() returns 0.


DECFLOAT (FB 4.0)
--------------

  Function:
    DB2-compliant numeric type. DECFLOAT precisely (unlike FLOAT or DOUBLE PRECISION that provide
    binary approximation) stores decimal values being therefore ideal choice for business appli-
    cations. Firebird according to IEEE standard has both 16- and 34-digit decimal float encodings.
    All intermediate calculations are performed with 34-digit values.

  Author:
    Alex Peshkoff <peshkoff@mail.ru>

  Syntax rules:
    DECFLOAT(16)
    DECFLOAT(34)

  Storage:
    64-bit / 128-bit, format according to IEEE 754.

  Example(s):
    1. DECLARE VARIABLE VAR1 DECFLOAT(34);
    2. CREATE TABLE TABLE1 (FIELD1 DECFLOAT(16));

  Note(s):
    1.	A number of standard functions can be used with DECFLOAT datatype. It is:
    	ABS, CEILING, EXP, FLOOR, LN, LOG, LOG10, POWER, SIGN, SQRT.
    	Agregate functions SUM, AVG, MAX and MIN also work with DECFLOAT data.
    	All statistics aggregates (like but not limited to STDDEV or CORR) work with DECFLOAT data.

    2.	Firebird supports four functions, specially designed to support DECFLOAT data:
    	- COMPARE_DECFLOAT - compares two DECFLOAT values to be equal, different or unordered.
    		Returns SMALLINT value which can be as follows:
    			0 - values are equal
    			1 - first value is less than second
    			2 - first value is greater than second
    			3 - values unordered (i.e. one or both is NAN / SNAN)
    		Unlike comparison operators ('<', '=', '>', etc.) comparison is exact - i.e.
    		COMPARE_DECFLOAT(2.17, 2.170) returns 2, not 0.
    	- NORMALIZE_DECFLOAT - has single DECFLOAT argument returned in it's simplest form.	That
    		means that for any nonzero value trailing zero are removed with appropriate correction
    		of an exponent. For example NORMALIZE_DECFLOAT(12.00) returns 12 and 
    		NORMALIZE_DECFLOAT(120) returns 1.2E+2.
    	- QUANTIZE - has two DECFLOAT arguments. The returned value is first argument scaled using
    		second value as a pattern. For example QUANTIZE(1234, 9.999) returns 1234.000.
    	- TOTALORDER - compares two DECFLOAT values including any special value. The comparison is
    		exact. Returns SMALLINT value which can be as follows:
    			-1 - first value is less than second
    			 0 - values are equal
    			 1 - first value is greater than second
    		DECFLOAT values are ordered as follows:
    			-nan < -snan < -inf < -0.1 < -0.10 < -0 < 0 < 0.10 < 0.1 < inf < snan < nan

	3.	Firebird supports new session control operator SET DECFLOAT. It has following forms:
			SET DECFLOAT ROUND <mode> - controls rounding mode used in operations with DECFLOAT
				values. Valid modes are: CEILING (towards +infinity), UP (away from 0), HALF_UP
				(to nearest, if equidistant - up), HALF_EVEN (to nearest, if equidistant - ensure
				last digit in the result to be even), HALF_DOWN (to nearest, if equidistant - down),
				DOWN (towards 0), FLOOR (towards -infinity), REROUND (up if digit to be rounded is
				0 or 5, down in other cases).

			SET DECFLOAT TRAPS TO <comma-separated traps list - may be empty> - controls which
				exceptional conditions cause a trap. Valid traps are: Division_by_zero, Inexact,
				Invalid_operation, Overflow and Underflow. By default traps are set to:
				Division_by_zero, Invalid_operation, Overflow, Underflow.

			SET DECFLOAT BIND <bind-type> - controls how are DECFLOAT values represented in outer
				world (i.e. in messages or in XSQLDA). Valid binding types are: NATIVE (use IEEE754
				binary representation), CHAR/CHARACTER (use ASCII string), DOUBLE PRECISION (use
				8-byte FP representation - same as used for DOUBLE PRECISION fields) or BIGINT
				with possible comma-separated SCALE clause (i.e. 'BIGINT, 3'). Various bindings
				are useful if one plans to use DECFLOAT values with some old client not supporting
				native format. One can choose between strings (ideal precision, but poor support
				for further processing), floating point values (ideal support for further processing
				but poor precision) or scaled integers (good support for further processing and
				required precision but range of values is very limited). When using is a tool like
				generic purporse GUI client choice of CHAR binding is OK in most cases.
