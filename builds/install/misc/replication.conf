	# Size of the local buffer used to accumulate changes that can be
	# deferred until the transaction commit/rollback. The bigger this value
	# the less disk access concurrency (related to log IOPS) happens.
	#
	# For synchronous replication, it also affects number of network round-trips
	# between primary and replica hosts.
	# However, a larger buffer costs a longer replication "checkpoints"
	# (delay to synchronize the original database with its replica at commit).
	#
	# buffer_size = 1048576 # 1MB

	# Maximum allowed number of full replication segments. Once this limit is reached,
	# the replication process is temporarily delayed to allow the archiving to catch up. 
 	# If any of the full segments is not archived during one minute,
 	# the replication fails with an error.
 	#
	# Zero means an unlimited number of segments pending archiving.

	# log_segment_count = 8

	# Delay, in milliseconds, to wait before the changes are synchronously flushed
	# to the log (usually at commit time). This allows multiple concurrently committing
	# transactions to amortise I/O costs by sharing a single flush operation.

	# log_archive_directory = 

	# Program (complete command line with arguments) that is executed when some
	# replication segment gets full and needs archiving.
	#
	# This program MUST return zero ONLY if archiving has been performed successfully.
	# In particular, it MUST return non-zero if the target archive already exists.
	#
	# Special predefined macros are available:
	#   $(logfilename) - file name (without path) of the log segment being archived
	#   $(logpathname) - full path name of the log segment being archived
	#     same as log_directory + $(logfilename)      
	#   $(archpathname) - suggested full path name for the archived segment
	#     same as log_archive_directory + $(logfilename)      
	#
	# Simplest configuration is to use standard OS commands for archiving, e.g.:
	#
	# Linux: "test ! -f $(archpathname) && cp $(logpathname) $(archpathname)"
	# or
	# Windows: "copy $(logpathname) $(archpathname)"
	#
	# log_archive_command = 

	# Timeout, in seconds, to wait until incomplete segment is scheduled for archiving.
	# It allows to minimize the replication gap if the database is modified rarely.
	#
	# Zero means no intermediate archiving, i.e. segments are archived only after
	# reaching their maximum size (defined by log_segment_size).
 	#
	# log_archive_timeout = 60

	# Connection string to the replica database (used for synchronous replication only).
	# Expected format:
